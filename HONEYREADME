# AWS + T-Pot Honeypot Deployment

## Introduction

This project focuses on setting up a honeypot using AWS and T-Pot to detect unauthorized or malicious activity on a network. A honeypot mimics legitimate parts of an information system to lure potential attackers, revealing their methods and intentions. This enables the enhancement of security measures in real systems.

## Installation

### AWS Setup

1. **Log into AWS**: Access the EC2 service.
2. **Select Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS**: Choose an appropriate instance type based on your needs (e.g., `t2.micro` for free tier).
3. **Security Configuration**: Initially set your security group to allow SSH only from your IP.
4. **Storage Setup**: Allocate 30 GiB of `gp3` storage for the instance.

### T-Pot Installation

After setting up your Ubuntu instance on AWS:

```bash
sudo passwd ubuntu  # Set a root password
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y  # Update and upgrade the system
ssh-keygen  # Generate an SSH key
git clone https://github.com/dtag-dev-sec/t-pot-autoinstall.git
cd t-pot-autoinstall/
sudo su
./install.sh  # Follow the prompts during installation
```

## Usage

To manage your honeypot, use the following commands:

```bash
ssh -i "path/to/key.pem" ubuntu@your-instance-ip -p 64295
```

This command connects you to the T-Pot instance using a custom SSH port set during the installation.

## Configuration

Modify the security group settings as needed to enhance honeypot security:

1. **SSH Access**: Change the port to 64295.
2. **Web Dashboard Access**: Enable port 64297 for web access.

## Security

- Ensure that only your IP can access the SSH and web dashboard ports.
- Regularly update your security rules based on threat analysis.

## Accessing the Dashboard

Access the web dashboard through:

https://your-instance-ip:64297
```

Login with the username `ubuntu` and the password set during installation.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues connecting to your instance or accessing the web dashboard, ensure your IP is correctly listed in your AWS security group settings.
